# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The overall purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and plot a graph showing the weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
Urban fares are higher than rural and suburban fares in general. The general trajectory of the lines are similar (as one increases, other lines will increase too and vise versa).

Furthermore, there are a much higher number of total rides from urban cities than from rural and suburban combined. Thus, the total amount paid in fares is much higher in urban cities. However, the average fare per ride has the opposite order meaning, what was highest in total fares is now the lowest and vise versa. This makes sense as thereâ€™s less people to divide the fares to thus increasing averages. This idea is reinforced by the average fare per driver since there are much fewer drivers than riders, the average fare per rides are much higher for the top 2 yet lower for the urban cities. This is because there are more total drivers than total ride.

## Summary
The following are recommendations for addressing the disparities among the city types:
  1.	Reduce the number of total drivers in urban areas
  2.	Increase the number of drivers in both suburban and rural areas (specifically during April)
  3.	If neither of the above, increase the price/fare for suburban and rural areas.
